# Global-Black-Money-Transaction-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the Global Black Money Transaction Dataset to uncover insights into financial irregularities and potential money laundering. Using advanced data wrangling, transformation, and descriptive statistical analysis techniques, this project identifies patterns, anomalies, and key indicators of suspicious transactions.
# Dataset Description
The Global Money Transactions Dataset provides a comprehensive view of financial movements often linked to illicit activities across multiple countries. The dataset includes:
Transaction Amount (USD)
Country (categorical)
Money Laundering Risk Score (numerical)
Transaction Date (DateTime)
# METHODOLOGY
1. Data cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics and analyzing the distribution of transaction amounts and risk scores.
3. Data Transformation: Aggregating data by country, industry, or transaction type.
4. Anomaly Detection: Identifying transactions with unusually high/low amounts or risk scores.
5. Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between transaction amounts, industries, and risk scores.
# KEY FINDINGS
